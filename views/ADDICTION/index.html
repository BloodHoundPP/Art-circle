    Pune Institute of Computer Technology [PICT] organized its annual cultural program during 19th
    April- 21st April-2022 in PICT campus. This is the most awaited day for all the students of the
    college. Like the other years, event coordinator published the official notification for all the
    students along with professors. All the students were requested to participate in the program. First
    day of the event was to be the inaugural day with dhol processing, the Second day was Traditional
    day and the last day was the Contradiction & Masquerade Day.
    <!-- PICT is well known for its technical talents, but the cultural talents make their own statement. Spread over three days Addiction is not an event but a mood – one of joy, happiness, colour and lots of dancing and entertainment. The first thought that strikes every organizing team is to make this version of event much better than the previous ones. This was achieved after a lot of brainstorming by all the teams on deciding the themes for the event  -->
